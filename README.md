This is a simple Python script that checks how strong a password is.
It looks at things like how long the password is, whether it has uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 
After checking, it gives the user some feedback on whether their password is strong enough or if they should make it better. 
This is just a basic tool for learning, so donâ€™t use it as your only security check!  :)
